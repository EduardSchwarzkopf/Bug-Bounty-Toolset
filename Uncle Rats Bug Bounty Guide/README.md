### Basic Tips

- Bug bounties is NOT pentesting
-- Bug bounty targets have been tested before
-- internally by the company
-- by pentesters before us
-- probably automatic tools
- spend time picking a good target
-- as much as you need
-- in can be the difference between finding a bug and finding frustration
- finding a valid bug requires
-- speed
-- creativity
-- or both
- we can either be
-- the first to find and scan subdomain
-- the one to outsmart everyone
-- or both
- Dont follow a methodology. it doesn't help
-- build an intution for bugs instead
- dont mourn for dupes
-- they are also valid bugs be faster next time or think different
- dont forget take notes
-- we want to test our target over multiply days
-- we want restest our target often
--- agile release cycles are 2 weeks!! (not of acompanies use agile)
-- we want to test complicated scenario's

### Picking a platform

- 4 Types of platfroms
-- Major plattfroms, well known
-- regional plattfroms, less known
-- private plattfroms, can only join by application
-- self hosted bug bounty programs such as google or security.txt

#### Major platfroms
- intigrit (no negative karma)
- bugcrowd
- hackerone (negativ karma - bad reports result less reports possible)

#### Regional platfroms
- google for regional ones
- less hackers, more chances

### Picking a target

#### Different categries
- we can notice several properties when we look at targets
-- B2B vs B2C target
-- Wide scope vs main app
-- web app vs mobile vs desktop vs ...
-- VDP vs PAID
-- Public vs private program

- uncle rat recommends:
-- B2B targets
-- main app
-- web app
--- is harder but also has less compition
-- PAID but i recommend starting with VDP
--- Get those invites private programs before you get cash
-- private programs but first you need to get invites
-- prigrams where syou can create or receive different users of different priviledge levels
